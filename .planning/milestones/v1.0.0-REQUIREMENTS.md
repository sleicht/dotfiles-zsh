# Archived Requirements: v1.0.0 Dotfiles Stack Migration

**Milestone:** v1.0.0
**Shipped:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** Cross-platform dotfiles that "just work" -- one repository that handles Mac vs Linux differences through templating, without requiring Nix expertise to maintain.

## v1 Requirements (All Complete)

### Preparation

- [x] **PREP-01**: Create complete backup of current dotfiles state before migration
- [x] **PREP-02**: Create emergency recovery scripts that restore working shell if migration breaks
- [x] **PREP-03**: Set up Linux test environment (Docker/VM) for cross-platform validation

### chezmoi Migration

- [x] **CHEM-01**: Initialize chezmoi and migrate all Dotbot symlinks with working shell
- [x] **CHEM-02**: Add OS detection templating (macOS vs Linux conditionals)
- [x] **CHEM-03**: Add machine-specific templating (hostname-based work vs personal detection)
- [x] **CHEM-04**: Template tool configurations (git, mise, sheldon, etc.)

### Package Management

- [x] **PKGM-01**: Implement automated Homebrew installation via run_onchange scripts
- [x] **PKGM-02**: Consolidate Brewfile_Client and Brewfile_Fanaka into .chezmoidata format
- [x] **PKGM-03**: Remove Nix completely (nix-config/, nix-darwin, Home Manager, Nix itself)

### Tool Version Management (mise)

- [x] **MISE-01**: Install mise, configure global settings, migrate all .tool-versions, remove asdf
- [x] **MISE-02**: Configure mise environment variable management (replace direnv functionality)
- [ ] **MISE-03**: Set up mise task runner for common development tasks -- deferred to v2

### Security

- [x] **SECU-01**: Integrate Bitwarden for secret templating in chezmoi configs
- [x] **SECU-02**: Implement age encryption for sensitive files committed to git
- [x] **SECU-03**: Install pre-commit hooks with gitleaks for secret leakage prevention
- [x] **SECU-04**: Verify and harden file permissions on sensitive files (600 for credentials)

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 16 total (MISE-03 deferred to v2)
- Completed: 15/15 in-scope requirements
- Deferred: 1 (MISE-03)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| 1Password integration | Using Bitwarden instead |
| Moving all Homebrew packages to mise | Most CLI tools work fine in Homebrew; only runtimes move to mise |
| Windows support | Not a current need |
| Nix-style reproducibility | Accepting Homebrew version drift as trade-off for simplicity |
| Terminal emulator changes | Keep current Ghostty/WezTerm/Kitty configs as-is |
