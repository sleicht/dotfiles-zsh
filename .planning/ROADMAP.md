### v2.0 Performance (Active)

**Milestone Goal:** Achieve < 300ms shell startup time through profiling, lazy loading, and eval caching.

**Target:** 870ms -> < 300ms wall-clock, < 50ms first-prompt lag (zsh-bench)

#### Phase 19: Baseline & Quick Wins

**Goal:** Establish measurement baseline, apply zero-risk optimisations.

**Requirements:** PROF-01, QUICK-01, QUICK-02, QUICK-03, QUICK-04

**Scope:**
- Install zsh-bench, establish three-stage baseline (hyperfine, EPOCHREALTIME, zsh-bench)
- Remove duplicate zsh-autosuggestions + zsh-syntax-highlighting loads from hooks.zsh
- Replace Ruby SSH config parsing with pure-zsh
- Replace `command -v` with `(( $+commands[tool] ))`
- Add `typeset -U PATH path FPATH fpath`
- Re-measure after changes

**Expected savings:** ~100-150ms (from removing duplicate loads + Ruby parsing)
**Risk:** LOW — no architecture changes, all reversible

#### Phase 20: Eval Caching Layer

**Goal:** Cache all expensive `eval "$(tool init)"` calls and sheldon output.

**Requirements:** CACHE-01, CACHE-02, CACHE-03, CACHE-04, CACHE-05, CACHE-06

**Scope:**
- Add evalcache (mroth/evalcache) as Sheldon plugin
- Cache oh-my-posh init (sync, prompt-critical)
- Cache zoxide, atuin, carapace, intelli-shell init
- Cache sheldon source output to file with mtime-based invalidation
- zcompile .zcompdump in background (.zlogin)
- Simplify compinit to always use `-C`
- Measure improvement

**Expected savings:** ~250-400ms (brings total from ~720ms to ~320-470ms)
**Risk:** LOW — behaviour identical, only source changes from subprocess to file
**Dependency:** None (Phase 19 provides baseline but is not blocking)

#### Phase 21: Sync/Defer Architecture Split

**Goal:** Move non-critical startup work after first prompt via Sheldon plugin group split.

**Requirements:** LAZY-01, LAZY-02, LAZY-03, LAZY-04, LAZY-05, LAZY-06

**Scope:**
- Split hooks.zsh into prompt.zsh (sync) and remove redundant sources
- Split external.zsh into external-sync.zsh (FZF exports) + external-defer.zsh (zoxide, mise)
- Split completions.zsh into sync (zstyles) + defer (SSH hosts, autoloads)
- Update plugins.toml with dotfiles-sync and dotfiles-defer groups
- Add `mise activate --shims` to .zprofile as immediate PATH fallback
- Defer: ssh-add, intelli-shell, completion definitions (lens, wt, xlaude)
- Measure improvement

**Expected savings:** ~100-200ms perceived (deferred work invisible to user)
**Risk:** MEDIUM — file refactoring, ordering constraints
**Dependency:** Phase 20 (evalcache must be in place for cached evals in deferred files)

#### Phase 22: Monitoring & Hardening

**Goal:** Prevent regressions and ensure long-term maintainability.

**Requirements:** PROF-02, PROF-03, PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03, PERF-04

**Scope:**
- Add startup time self-monitoring (warn if > 300ms)
- Create smoke test script (prompt styled, tools on PATH, no double-loads, completions work)
- Add chezmoi run_onchange_ hook to clear eval caches on tool version change
- Final three-stage measurement confirming < 300ms target
- Document benchmarking methodology

**Expected savings:** 0ms (preventive)
**Risk:** LOW — monitoring only
**Dependency:** Phase 21 (all optimisations in place)

- [x] Phase 19: Baseline & Quick Wins — **Plans:** 2 plans — completed 2026-02-14
  - [x] 19-01-PLAN.md — Establish three-stage performance baseline
  - [x] 19-02-PLAN.md — Apply quick wins (QUICK-01 to QUICK-04) and re-measure
- [x] Phase 20: Eval Caching Layer — **Plans:** 2 plans — completed 2026-02-14
  - [x] 20-01-PLAN.md — Add evalcache plugin, simplify compinit, cache sheldon source, background zcompile
  - [x] 20-02-PLAN.md — Convert eval init calls to evalcache and measure improvement
- [x] Phase 21: Sync/Defer Architecture Split — **Plans:** 2 plans — completed 2026-02-14
  - [x] 21-01-PLAN.md — Split zsh.d files into sync/defer pairs, add mise shims to .zprofile
  - [x] 21-02-PLAN.md — Reconfigure Sheldon plugins.toml with sync/defer groups and measure
- [ ] Phase 22: Monitoring & Hardening — **Plans:** 2 plans
  - [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md — Self-monitoring, conditional zprof, and evalcache invalidation hook
  - [ ] 22-02-PLAN.md — Smoke test script and final three-stage performance measurement
